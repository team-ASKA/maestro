3. **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions
4. **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms for API failures

## üß™ Development & Testing

### Test LLM Integration

In development mode, a "TEST LLM" button appears in the sage interface for testing:

- Tests Azure OpenAI connection
- Tests with financial context
- Tests PDF analysis API connectivity

### Environment Validation

The app automatically validates required environment variables on startup and provides clear error messages for missing configurations.

2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test API connectivity using the development test button
4. Review the fallback response system for offline functionality
